# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overiew

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring Pewlett-Hackard employees per title and identify retiring-employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The mentorship program is designed to pair experienced and successful employees with new hires. This allows retirement-eligible employees to step back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely.

In the current mentorship program, there are 1,549 qualified, retirement-ready employees. 36.7% hold a Senior Staff position while only 10.9% of mentors hold a Senior Engineer position. There is not enough qualified Senior Engineers to adequately mentor the next generation. However, across departments, there are enough employees.
